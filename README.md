The goal of this project was to find numerical solutions to the three body problem of two moons circling around a big planet. 
The file chasing_the_moon.py contains the project.
The files forwards_euler.py and backwards_euler.py contain simple and ugly proof of concepts. 
The forwards euler method was used to solve the differential equation in the three body problem.
